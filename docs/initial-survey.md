## Questions

### What projects related to signals do you work on?

### How do you imagine standard signals integrating with that project?

### Should developers use standard signals directly, or are they more of a primitive for libraries/frameworks?

### How would you design an MVP standard signal API? Use concrete code samples, and just sketch out your initial thoughts; it doesn't have to be perfect.

### What requirements do you have on how computed/effect dependencies are tracked? How should this be divided between the standard and libraries/frameworks?

### What requirements do you have on scheduling execution of computed/effect?  How should this be divided between the standard and libraries/frameworks?

### There is a lot of discussion about "push-based" vs "pull-based" mechanisms, as well as the notion of signals being "lossy" (meaning they don't necessarily deliver every value to their computations/effects, only the last value). What are your thoughts on these areas?

### Do you have any opinions on the various different graph algorithms for handling signals?

### Do you have any opinions on whether or how signals might be integrated with other standards, such as the DOM standard?

### Do you have any other requirements/needs/considerations for signals from your side?
